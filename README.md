The following repository consists of my Robotics Projects that I did during the my Masters for each course as a Final Project.

It consists of  projects :
  1. Intro to Robotics - The project shows how to program a trajectory to the Kuka robot iiwa 7 R800 to position its end effector inside a prescribed area while accounting to the potential singularities and self collision.
  2. Mechatronics - Collaborated in designing an autonomous Mobile robot as a team with the purpose of detecting the buildings on fire. I contributed in telemetry and algorithmic design for control of the robot.
